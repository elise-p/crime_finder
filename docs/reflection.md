Identify which of the course topics you applied (e.g. secure data persistence) and describe how you applied them.
- We applied GPS, which is to get the current location of the device to get the distance between the crime scene and the current location and display the result.

- We applied data secure persistence to save the name of the saved current location, so that when the user comes back the name is still stored

- We applied stateful and stateless widget on our view page.

- We querying web services by querying the crime API from a website that stores the value in json type, and query it to store in our database

- Properties of People: Vision: We make the color contrast in our app to be minimum 3:1 and based on the contrast color guideline.

- Properties of People: Motor Control (e.g. Fittsâ€™s Law): We try to make all labels of our buttons and navigation bar clear so that the user knows which button to click based on their needs.

Describe what changed from your original concept to your final implementation? Why did you make those changes from your original design vision?
- Our app is similar to our original concept, as we implemented the map, the view to show the list of crime of our current location, and also saving names based on our previous locations. We just add more details to the design and color, like adding description to the icon of the navigator bar. However, we are not able to implement the notifications on phone on time, but we are able to put a warning around the nearest crime. 

Discuss how doing this project challenged and/or deepened your understanding of these topics.
- This project challenges us to understand how to query an API in terms of querying web services, as that is the main thing that we have never really do. We need to learn how to find the correct data from the internet, and how to use await and future features to query an API and get the data that we needed. We learned that we need to use https features to query an API, and need to create a location datatype to store the values easier.

Describe two areas of future work for your app, including how you could increase the accessibility and usability of this app
- In future works, we can get better API which also updates the current location, and we will make it live, by changing the crime lists as the API updates. We will also add notification to the phone directly instead of only in the app when there is a crime nearby.

We also asked Lauren and Davin for help on the project.

What do you feel was the most valuable thing you learned in CSE 340 that will help you beyond this class, and why?
- We feel like the most valuable thing we learned is the accessing sensor as it is generally required for some apps, and we also think that accessibility is also important so that we can have a larger range of users in our app and makes the app easier to use.

If you could go back and give yourself 2-3 pieces of advice at the beginning of the class, what would you say and why? (Alternatively: what 2-3 pieces of advice would you give to future students who take CSE 340 and why?
- We would advice the students to start early on assignments so that you can go to office hours.
- It is also important to understand the materials and guideline first before doing the assignments
- Manage your time on doing peer audits and fixing your assignments for resubmission.

Audit Changes

The two topics discussed in the accessibility audit were color contrast (for buttons and the bottom appbar) and semantics labels. We agreed with them both. For color contrast, we changed the 'pin' button in the pin_location feature from the default to a larger button and more accessible color, since it previously blended in with the background too well and was too small to press easily. We also changed the color of the bottom AppBar to black with white text and icons. Since no other features of the app are colored black, this will allow the bottom AppBar to be visible for vision-impaired users. For semantics labels, we expanded upon the default labels by making them more descriptive. For instance, the bottom AppBar has the labels 'map', 'crime list', and 'pinned locations'.

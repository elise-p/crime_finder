Addressing a Human Need

Currently, there is a UWAlert, but they don't have data on how far you are from the crime location, so you need to search the location by yourself in order to know how far is it. Through this app, users can know how far the crime locations are located from them directly, so they can take actions based on the result of the main page. This minimize the time taken for users, as they just need to open one app directly instead of clicking off and open another map app to search for the location. Therefore this app is an improvement from the UWAlert feature.
